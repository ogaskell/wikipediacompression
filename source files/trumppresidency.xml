{{Donald Trump series}}

The '''presidency of Donald Trump''' began at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (17:00 UTC) on January 20, 2017, when [[Donald Trump]] was [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inaugurated]] as the [[List of presidents of the United States|45th]] [[president of the United States]], and ended on January 20, 2021. Trump, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] originally from [[New York City]], took office following his surprise [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], in which he did not win a plurality of the popular vote. Trump made many [[Veracity of statements by Donald Trump|false or misleading statements]] during his campaign and presidency. His presidency ended following his defeat in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]] by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Joe Biden]].

Trump was unsuccessful in his efforts to repeal the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA), but rescinded the [[Individual shared responsibility provision|individual mandate]] and took measures to hinder the ACA's functioning. Trump sought substantial spending cuts to major welfare programs, including [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]]. He signed the [[Great American Outdoors Act]], pursued [[energy independence]], reversed numerous [[Environmental policy of the Donald Trump administration|environmental regulations]], and [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|withdrew]] from the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Accord]]. He signed [[Criminal justice reform in the United States|criminal justice reform]] through the [[First Step Act]] and appointed three [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justices]] to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. In economic policy, he [[Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act|partially repealed the Dodd–Frank Act]] and signed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. He enacted [[Trump tariffs|tariffs]], triggering retaliatory tariffs from [[China–United States trade war|China]], Canada, Mexico, and the EU. He withdrew from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] negotiations and signed the [[USMCA]], a successor agreement to [[NAFTA]]. The [[federal deficit]] increased under Trump due to spending increases and tax cuts.

He implemented a controversial [[Trump administration family separation policy|family separation policy for migrants]] apprehended at the U.S.–Mexico border. Trump's demand for the federal funding of [[Trump wall|a border wall]] resulted in [[2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown|the longest US government shutdown in history]]. He [[2020 deployment of federal forces in the United States|deployed federal law enforcement forces]] in response to [[George Floyd protests|protests in 2020]]. Trump faced the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]] in his final year. He signed the [[CARES Act]] and a [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021|second stimulus package]] in response to the [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|economic impact of the pandemic]]. Trump's "[[America First (policy)|America First]]" [[Foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration|foreign policy]] was characterized by unilateral actions, disregarding traditional allies. The administration implemented [[2017 United States–Saudi Arabia arms deal|a major arms sale to Saudi Arabia]], [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel|recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel]], and denied citizens from several [[Executive Order 13769|Muslim-majority countries]] entry into the U.S. His administration withdrew U.S. troops from northern Syria, allowing [[2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria|Turkey to occupy the area]]. Trump met [[North Korea]]'s leader, [[Kim Jong-un]], three times. Trump [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement]], and later [[2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis|escalated tensions in the Persian Gulf]] by [[Assassination of Qasem Soleimani|ordering the assassination]] of General [[Qasem Soleimani]].

[[Robert Mueller]]'s [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel investigation]] (2017–2019) [[Mueller report|concluded]] that Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy, and that while the prevailing evidence "did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government", possible obstructions of justice occurred during the course of that investigation.

[[Trump–Ukraine scandal|Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine]] to announce investigations into his political rival Joe Biden, triggering his [[First impeachment of Donald Trump|first impeachment]] by the House of Representatives in December 2019, but he was [[First impeachment trial of Donald Trump|acquitted by the Senate]].

Following his loss in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]] to Biden, Trump refused to concede and initiated an [[Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election|aggressive pursuit to overturn the results]], alleging unproven claims of widespread [[electoral fraud]]. On January 6, 2021, during a rally at [[The Ellipse]], Trump urged his supporters to "fight like hell" and march to the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], where the [[2021 United States Electoral College vote count|electoral votes were being counted by Congress]] in order to formalize Biden's victory. A mob of Trump supporters [[2021 storming of the United States Capitol|stormed the Capitol]], suspending the count as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Mike Pence]] and other members of Congress were evacuated. On January 13, the House voted to [[Second impeachment of Donald Trump|impeach Trump an unprecedented second time]] for "[[Sedition|incitement of insurrection]]", but he was [[Second impeachment trial of Donald Trump|again acquitted by the Senate]].

On November 9, 2016, Republicans [[Donald Trump]] of New York and Governor [[Mike Pence]] of Indiana won the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]], defeating Democrats former Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] of New York and Senator [[Tim Kaine]] of Virginia. Trump won 304 electoral votes compared to Clinton's 227, though Clinton won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote, receiving nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump. Trump thus became the fifth person to [[List of United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|win the presidency while losing the popular vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/12/20/why-electoral-college-landslides-are-easier-to-win-than-popular-vote-ones/|title=Trump's victory another example of how Electoral College wins are bigger than popular vote ones|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the concurrent congressional elections, Republicans maintained majorities in both the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

One of Trump's major first year accomplishments, made as part of a "100{{nbh}}day pledge", was the confirmation of [[Neil Gorsuch]] as an [[associate justice of the Supreme Court]]. Despite the Republican Party holding a majority in both houses of Congress, however, he was unable to fulfill another hundred-day promise, repealing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] ("Obamacare").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/24/donald-trump/how-do-donald-trumps-first-100-days-rate-historica/|title=How do Donald Trump's first 100 days rate historically?|last=Jacobson|first=Louis|date=April 24, 2017|access-date=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trump administration had been characterized by record turnover, particularly among White House staff. {{As of|2018|3|pre=early}}, 43% of senior White House positions had turned over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/03/07/591372397/white-house-staff-turnover-was-already-record-setting-then-more-advisers-left|title=White House Staff Turnover Was Already Record-Setting.

By October 2019, one in 14 of Trump's political appointees were former lobbyists; less than three years into his presidency, Trump had appointed more than four times as many lobbyists than Obama did over the course of his first six years in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/we-found-a-staggering-281-lobbyists-whove-worked-in-the-trump-administration|title= We Found a "Staggering" 281 Lobbyists Who've Worked in the Trump Administration|last=Mora|first=David|date=October 15, 2019|website=ProPublica|access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Economic Advisers#Chairmen and members|Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers]], which had been added to the cabinet by Obama in 2009, was removed from the cabinet.

On February 13, 2017, Trump fired Michael Flynn from the post of [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] on grounds that he had lied to Vice President Pence about his communications with [[List of ambassadors of Russia to the United States|Russian Ambassador]] [[Sergey Kislyak]]; Flynn later pleaded guilty to lying to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) about his contacts with Russia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Goldman|first1=Adam|last2=Mazzetti|first2=Mark|date=May 14, 2020|title=Trump White House Changes Its Story on Michael Flynn|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/us/politics/trump-michael-flynn.html|access-date=May 20, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn was fired amidst the ongoing controversy concerning [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 election]] and accusations that Trump's electoral team colluded with Russian agents.

Secretary of Defense [[Jim Mattis]] informed Trump of his resignation following Trump's abrupt December 19, 2018, announcement that the remaining 2,000 American troops in Syria would be withdrawn, against the recommendations of his military and civilian advisors. In his resignation letter, Mattis appeared to criticize Trump's worldview, praising NATO, which Trump has often derided, as well as the Defeat-ISIS coalition Trump had just decided to abandon. Mattis's&lt;!--mat iss izz--&gt; resignation became effective on December 31, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='A sad day for America': Washington fears a Trump unchecked by Mattis|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-sad-day-for-america-washington-fears-a-trump-unchecked-by-mattis/2018/12/20/faef8da0-04ac-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump has fired numerous [[Inspector general|Inspectors General]] of agencies, including those who were probing the Trump administration and close Trump associates. In 2020, he fired five inspectors general in two months. ''The Washington Post'' wrote, "For the first time since the system was created in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, inspectors generally find themselves under systematic attack from the president, putting independent oversight of federal spending and operations at risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2020|title=As Trump removes federal watchdogs, some loyalists replacing them have 'preposterous' conflicts|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-trump-removes-federal-watchdogs-some-loyalists-replacing-them-have-extensive-conflicts/2020/05/24/8dad46a4-9b89-11ea-a2b3-5c3f2d1586df_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dismissal of James Comey===
{{Main|Dismissal of James Comey}}

Trump dismissed [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[James Comey]] on May 9, 2017, saying he had accepted the recommendations of Attorney General Sessions and [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[Rod Rosenstein]] to dismiss Comey.

===Supreme Court nominations===

Trump has made three nominations to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]: [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]], and [[Amy Coney Barrett]]:
* [[Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination|Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch]] in January 2017 to fill the vacancy left by the death of [[Antonin Scalia]] in February 2016, which had not been filled by Obama as the Republican-majority Senate did not consider the [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|nomination of Merrick Garland]].

* [[Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination|Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh]] in July 2018 to replace retiring Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], considered a key swing vote on the Supreme Court.

Shortly before Trump secured the 2016 Republican nomination, ''The New York Times'' reported "legal experts across the political spectrum say" Trump's rhetoric reflected "a constitutional worldview that shows contempt for the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law", adding "many conservative and libertarian legal scholars warn that electing Mr. Trump is a recipe for a constitutional crisis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/us/politics/donald-trump-constitution-power.html|title=Donald Trump Could Threaten U.S. Rule of Law, Scholars Say|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientists warned that candidate Trump's rhetoric and actions mimicked those of other politicians who ultimately turned authoritarian once in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|title=How democracies die|isbn=978-0-525-58795-8|oclc=1019872575}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have concluded that during Trump's tenure as president and largely due to his actions and rhetoric, the U.S. has experienced [[democratic backsliding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lieberman|first1=Robert C.|last2=Mettler|first2=Suzanne|last3=Pepinsky|first3=Thomas B.|last4=Roberts|first4=Kenneth M.|last5=Valelly|first5=Richard|date=2019|title=The Trump Presidency and American Democracy: A Historical and Comparative Analysis|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/trump-presidency-and-american-democracy-a-historical-and-comparative-analysis/E157E9BBA8D3E531A7DD4FD1A01E0478#.XrS0MSOp6ko.twitter|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=17|issue=2|pages=470–479|doi=10.1017/S1537592718003286|issn=1537-5927|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kaufman|first1=Robert R.|last2=Haggard|first2=Stephan|date=2018|title=Democratic Decline in the United States: What Can We Learn from Middle-Income Backsliding?|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=17|issue=2|pages=417–432|doi=10.1017/s1537592718003377|issn=1537-5927|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many prominent Republicans have expressed similar concerns that Trump's perceived disregard for the rule of law betrayed conservative principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhpr.org/post/bill-kristol-really-wants-someone-challenge-trump#stream/0|title=Bill Kristol Really Wants Someone to Challenge Trump|first=Peter|last=Biello|publisher=NHPR|access-date=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/opinion/republicans-midterms-trump.html|title=Opinion – Republicans Against Trump|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Just in time: A new Republican group seeks to protect Mueller", ''Washington Post'', April 11, 2018: https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/04/11/just-in-time-a-new-republican-group-seeks-to-protect-mueller/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conservative Lawyers Say Trump Has Undermined the Rule of Law|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/politics/conservative-lawyers-trump.html|access-date=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first two years of his presidency, Trump repeatedly sought to influence the Justice Department to investigate his political adversaries{{snd}}specifically Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, and FBI Director James Comey, whom he saw as his adversary.

Early into his presidency, Trump developed a highly contentious relationship with the news media, repeatedly referring to them as the "[[fake news]] media" and "the [[enemy of the people]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bondarenko|first=Veronika|title=Trump keeps saying 'enemy of the people' – but the phrase has a very ugly history|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-president-trumps-phrase-an-enemy-of-the-people-2017-2|website=Business Insider|access-date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a candidate, Trump had refused press credentials for offending publications but said he would not do so if elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/06/14/media/donald-trump-press-credentials-access/index.html|title=Donald Trump: I won't kick reporters out of White House press briefing room|last=Stelter|first=Brian|work=CNN Business|date=June 14, 2016|access-date=December 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump both privately and publicly mused about taking away critical reporters' [[White House press corps|White House press credentials]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/09/media/president-trump-press-credentials/index.html|title=Trump's latest shot at the press corps: 'Take away credentials?'|last=Collins|first=Brian Stelter and Kaitlan|work=CNNMoney|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Trump White House gave temporary press passes to far-right pro-Trump fringe outlets, such as ''[[InfoWars]]'' and ''[[The Gateway Pundit]]'', which are known for publishing hoaxes and conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/infowars-granted-white-house-press-credentials-2017-5|title=Conspiracy outlet InfoWars was granted temporary White House press credentials|work=Business Insider|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Grynbaum| first=Michael M.| title=White House Grants Press Credentials to a Pro-Trump Blog| website=[[The New York Times]]| date=February 13, 2017| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/business/the-gateway-pundit-trump.html| access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his first day in office, Trump falsely accused journalists of understating the size of the crowd at his inauguration, and called the news media "among the most dishonest human beings on earth".

====California wildfires====
In November 2018, while California experienced [[2018 California wildfires|one of its most destructive wildfires]], Trump blamed the fires on "gross" and "poor" "mismanagement" of forests by California, saying there was no other reason for these wildfires. ''The New York Times'' described Trump's claims as misleading, noting that the fires in question were not "forest fires", that most of the forest was owned by federal agencies, and that [[climate change]] in part contributed to the fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/fact-check-trump-california-fire-tweet.html|title=Trump's Misleading Claims About California's Fire 'Mismanagement'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|department=Fact Check|first=Kendra|last=Pierre-Louis|date=November 12, 2018|access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2020, [[2020 California wildfires|California's worst wildfires in history]] prompted the president to visit the state. In a briefing to state officials, he affirmed that federal assistance was necessary, and asserted that [[Deforestation in the United States|the lack of forestry]], not climate change, is the underlying cause of the fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/14/politics/donald-trump-wildfires-briefing-climate-change/index.html|title=Trump baselessly questions climate science during California wildfire briefing|first=Maegan|last=Vazquez|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump's economic policies have centered on cutting taxes, deregulation, and trade protectionism.

One of Trump's first actions was to indefinitely suspend a cut in fee rates for federally-insured mortgages implemented by the Obama administration which saved individuals with lower credit scores around $500 per year on a typical loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-fha-rate-cut-explained-20170123-story.html|title=Trump's team suspended a mortgage insurance rate cut.

The administration proposed changes to the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (food stamps), which if implemented would lead millions to lose access to food stamps and limit the amount of benefits for remaining recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Trump's proposed SNAP changes could mean millions lose food stamp access|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-administration-proposal-could-cause-millions-lose-food-stamps-n1092866|website=NBC News|access-date=December 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taxation====
In September 2017, the administration proposed a tax overhaul, which became the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. The proposal involved reducing the corporate tax rate, eliminating the estate tax, and changing the number of tax brackets from seven to three on individual returns. Other measures in the proposal included applying a 25% tax rate to business income reported on a personal tax return; eliminating the [[alternative minimum tax]] and personal exemptions; doubling the standard deduction; and eliminating many itemized deductions (specifically retaining the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Julie Hirschfeld|last2=Rappeport|first2=Alan|date=September 27, 2017|title=Trump Proposes the Most Sweeping Tax Overhaul in Decades|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/us/politics/trump-tax-cut-plan-middle-class-deficit.html|access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the administration singled out Florida for exemption from the administration's offshore drilling plan.

The move raised ethical questions about the appearance of "transactional favoritism" because Trump owns a coastal resort in Florida, and because of the state's status as a crucial "swing state" in the 2020 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/trump-looks-he-s-playing-favorites-florida-offshore-relief-n836381|title=Trump looks like he's playing favorites with Florida offshore relief|work=NBC News|access-date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states sought similar offshore drilling exemptions,&lt;ref&gt;Camila Domonoske, [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/10/577064733/after-florida-gets-offshore-drilling-exemption-other-states-ask-for-the-same After Florida Gets Offshore Drilling Exemption, Other States Ask For The Same], NPR (January 10, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; and litigation ensued.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kummer, [https://www.inquirer.com/philly/health/science/new-jersey-sues-u-s-why-was-florida-exempted-from-offshore-drilling-20181010.html New Jersey sues U.S.: Why was Florida exempted from offshore drilling?] (October 10, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Cournoyer, [https://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/tns-jersey-trump-offshore-drilling-florida-lawsuit.html Why Is Only Florida Exempt From Trump's Offshore Drilling Plan?

Despite rhetoric about boosting the coal industry, coal-fueled electricity generating capacity declined faster during Trump's presidency than during any previous presidential term, falling 15% with the idling of 145 coal-burning units at 75 power plants.

===Science===
{{Main|Trump administration political interference with science agencies}}
{{See also|Politicization of science#Trump administration}}

The administration marginalized the role of science in policymaking, halted numerous research projects, and saw the departure of scientists who said their work was marginalized or suppressed.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; It was the first administration since 1941 not to name a [[Science Advisor to the President]]. While preparing for talks with [[Kim Jong-un]], the White House did not do so with the assistance of a White House science adviser or senior counselor trained in [[nuclear physics]]. The position of chief scientist in the State Department or the Department of Agriculture was not filled. The administration nominated [[Sam Clovis]] to be chief scientist in the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], but he had no scientific background and the White House later withdrew the nomination. The administration successfully nominated [[Jim Bridenstine]], who had no background in science and rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, to lead [[NASA]]. The [[U.S. Department of the Interior]], the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) disbanded advisory committees,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/09/climate/trump-administration-science.html|title=In the Trump Administration, Science Is Unwelcome.

During the 2020 [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the Trump administration replaced career public affairs staff at the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] with political appointees, including [[Michael Caputo]], who interfered with weekly [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) scientific reports and attempted to silence the government's most senior infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, "sowing distrust of the FDA at a time when health leaders desperately need people to accept a vaccine in order to create the immunity necessary to defeat the novel coronavirus".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='It just created a public relations nightmare': Inside Michael Caputo's time at HHS|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/16/how-michael-caputo-shook-up-hhs-416632|access-date=September 25, 2020|website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day after Trump noted that he might dismiss an FDA proposal to improve standards for emergency use of a coronavirus vaccine, the Presidents of the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Academies]] of Sciences and Medicine issued a statement expressing alarm at political interference in science during a pandemic, "particularly the overriding of evidence and advice from public health officials and derision of government scientists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=September 24, 2020|title=NAS and NAM Presidents Alarmed By Political Interference in Science Amid Pandemic|url=https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/09/nas-and-nam-presidents-alarmed-by-political-interference-in-science-amid-pandemic|access-date=September 25, 2020|website=National Academies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Owermohle|first=Sarah|title=Science academies sound alarm on political interference|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/24/national-academy-sciences-coronavirus-political-interference-421118|access-date=September 25, 2020|website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveillance===
In 2019, Trump signed into law a six-year extension of Section 702 of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]], allowing the NSA to conduct searches of foreigners' communications without any warrant. The process incidentally collects information from Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Volz|first=Dustin|date=January 20, 2018|title=Trump signs bill renewing NSA's internet surveillance program|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cyber-surveillance/trump-signs-bill-renewing-nsas-internet-surveillance-program-idUSKBN1F82MK|access-date=June 27, 2019|website=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veterans affairs===
Prior to [[David Shulkin]]'s firing in April 2018, ''The New York Times'' described the [[U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) as a "rare spot of calm in the Trump administration". Shulkin built upon changes started under the Obama administration to do a long-term overhaul of the VA system.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/va-medical-system-chaos.html|title=V.A.

In August 2018, ''ProPublica'' reported that three wealthy patrons of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, formed an "informal council" that strongly influenced VA policy, including reviewing a confidential $10{{nbs}}billion contract to modernize the VA's records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/ike-perlmutter-bruce-moskowitz-marc-sherman-shadow-rulers-of-the-va|title=The Shadow Rulers of the VA|last=Arnsdorf|first=Isaac|date=August 7, 2018|website=ProPublica|access-date=August 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government Accountability Office]] announced in November 2018 that it would investigate the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/26/mar-a-lago-trump-investigation-va-contracts-1015803|title=Watchdog office to probe Mar-a-Lago members' influence at VA|publisher=[[Politico]]|access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
In 2018, Trump signed into law the VA MISSION Act, which expanded eligibility for the [[Veterans Choice]] program, allowing veterans greater access to private sector healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Slack, Donovan, "Trump signs VA law to provide veterans more private health care choices."

===Voting rights===
Under the Trump administration, the Justice Department limited enforcement actions to protect [[voting rights]], and in fact often defended restrictions on voting rights imposed by various states that have been challenged as [[Voter suppression in the United States|voter suppression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michael|last=Wines|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/12/us/voting-rights-voter-id-suppression.html|title=Voting Rights Advocates Used to Have an Ally in the Government.

It was chaired by Vice President Pence, while the day-to-day administrator was [[Kris Kobach]], best known for promoting restrictions on access to voting. The commission began its work by requesting each state to turn over detailed information about all registered voters in their database. Most states rejected the request, citing privacy concerns or state laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Liz|last1=Stark|first2=Grace|last2=Hauck|date=July 5, 2017|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/03/politics/kris-kobach-letter-voter-fraud-commission-information/index.html|title=Forty-four states and DC have refused to give certain voter information to Trump commission|access-date=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple lawsuits were filed against the commission.

On August 13, 2017, Trump condemned violence "on many sides" after a gathering of hundreds of [[white nationalists]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], the previous day (August 12) turned deadly.

In 2020, the Trump administration asserted that the U.S. remained a “participant” in the [[Iran nuclear deal framework|Iran Deal]], despite having formally withdrawn in 2018, to persuade the [[United Nations Security Council]] to reimpose pre-agreement sanctions on Iran for its breaches of the deal after the U.S. withdrawal. The agreement provided for a resolution process among signatories in the event of a breach, but that process had not yet played out.

===Israel / Palestine===
Since the [[Six-Day War|Six Day War]] in 1967, the United States had considered [[Israeli settlement]]s in the occupied [[West Bank]] to be "illegitimate". This status changed in November 2019 when the Trump administration shifted U.S. policy and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50468025|title=Jewish settlements no longer illegal – US|date=November 18, 2019|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; declared "the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not ''per se'' inconsistent with international law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-to-deliver-statement/|title=Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announces reversal of Obama-era stance on Israeli settlements|website=www.cbsnews.com|date=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Arab Emirates===
As Donald Trump lost the election bid against Joe Biden, the U.S. State Department notified Congress about its plans to sell 18 sophisticated armed [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9B aerial drones]] to the [[United Arab Emirates]], under a deal worth $2.9 billion. The drones were expected to be equipped with maritime radar, and the delivery was being estimated by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-emirates-drones-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-advances-29-billion-drone-sale-to-uae-sources-idUSKBN27M06L|title= Trump administration advances $2.9 billion drone sale to UAE – sources|access-date=November 5, 2020|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, another informal notification was sent to the Congress regarding the plans of providing the UAE with $10 billion of defense equipment, including precision-guided munitions, non-precision bombs and missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-emirates-ordnance/trump-administration-advances-10-billion-defense-sale-to-uae-source-idINL1N2HT026|title=Trump administration advances $10 billion defense sale to UAE – source|access-date=November 6, 2020|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a candidate and as president, Trump called for a major build-up of American military capabilities Trump announced in October 2018 that America would withdraw from the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] with Russia to enable America to counter increasing Chinese intermediate nuclear missile capabilities in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/politics/russia-nuclear-arms-treaty-trump-administration.html|title=U.S. to Tell Russia It Is Leaving Landmark I.N.F.

Trump said the $716{{nbs}}billion America is now spending on the "arms race" was "Crazy!", after praising his increased defense spending five months earlier. The total fiscal 2019 defense budget authorization was $716{{nbs}}billion, although missile defense and nuclear programs made up about $10{{nbs}}billion of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/donald-trump-speech.html|title=Donald Trump Vows to Bolster Nation's Military Capacities|last1=Parker|first1=Ashley|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Matthew|date=September 7, 2016|newspaper=New York Times|access-date=December 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/world/middleeast/obama-nuclear-security-summit-iran.html|title=Obama Rebukes Donald Trump's Comments on Nuclear Weapons|last=Landler|first=Mark|date=April 1, 2016|newspaper=New York Times|access-date=December 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2018, Trump falsely asserted he had secured the largest defense budget authorization ever, the first military pay raise in ten years, and that military spending was at least 4.0% of GDP, "which got a lot bigger since I became your president".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3 False Claims From Trump's Naval Academy Speech|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/us/politics/fact-check-trump-naval-academy-speech.html|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy arose in November 2019 after Trump pardoned or promoted three soldiers accused or convicted of war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-announces-review-green-beret-murder-case-we-train-our-n1065421|title=Trump announces 'review' of Green Beret murder case: 'We train our boys to be killing machines'|website=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent case involved [[Eddie Gallagher (Navy SEAL)|Eddie Gallagher]], a Navy SEAL team chief who had been reported to Navy authorities by his own team members for [[sniper|sniping]] at an unarmed civilian girl and an elderly man. Gallagher faced [[court martial]] for the murder of a wounded teenage combatant, among other charges, and the medic of his SEAL team was granted immunity to testify against him, but on the witness stand the medic reversed what he had previously told investigators and testified that he himself had murdered the terrorist suspect. Gallagher was subsequently acquitted of the murder charge against him, and the Navy demoted him to the lowest possible rank due to his conviction on another charge. The Navy later moved to strip Gallagher of his [[Special Warfare insignia|Trident pin]] and eject him from the Navy. Trump intervened to restore Gallagher's rank and pin. Many military officers were enraged by Trump's intervention, as they felt it disrupted principles of military discipline and justice. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Richard V. Spencer|Richard Spencer]] protested Trump's intervention and was forced to resign; in his resignation letter, he sharply rebuked Trump for his judgment in the matter. Trump told a rally audience days later, "I stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/us/navy-seals-edward-gallagher-trident.html|title=Navy Wants to Eject From SEALs a Sailor Cleared by Trump, Officials Say|first=Dave|last=Philipps|date=November 19, 2019|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/trump-seals-eddie-gallagher.html|title=Trump Reverses Navy Decision to Oust Edward Gallagher From SEALs|first=Dave|last=Philipps|date=November 21, 2019|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/472201-trump-says-he-stood-up-to-the-deep-state-by-intervening-in-war-crime-cases|title=Trump says he stood up to the 'deep state' by intervening in war crime cases|first=Brett|last=Samuels|date=November 26, 2019|website=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his January 2017 confirmation hearings as the attorney general nominee before the Senate, then-Senator Jeff Sessions appeared to deliberately omit two meetings he had in 2016 with Russian Ambassador [[Sergey Kislyak]], when asked if he had meetings involving the 2016 election with Russian government officials.

Trump went to great lengths to keep details of his private conversations with Russian president Putin secret, including in one case by retaining his interpreter's notes and instructing the linguist to not share the contents of the discussions with anyone in the administration. As a result, there were no detailed records, even in classified files, of Trump's conversations with Putin on five occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-has-concealed-details-of-his-face-to-face-encounters-with-putin-from-senior-officials-in-administration/2019/01/12/65f6686c-1434-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html|title=Trump has concealed details of his face-to-face encounters with Putin from senior officials in administration|work=The Washington Post|last=Miller|first=Greg|date=January 13, 2019|access-date=December 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samuels|first=Brett|date=January 29, 2019|title=Trump, Putin talked at G20 without US translator, note-taker: report|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/427505-trump-putin-talked-at-g20-without-us-translator-note-taker-report|website=TheHill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2019, Trump asserted he saw nothing wrong in accepting intelligence on his political adversaries from foreign powers, such as Russia, and he could see no reason to contact the FBI about it. Responding to a reporter who told him FBI director [[Christopher A. Wray|Christopher Wray]] had said such activities should be reported to the FBI, Trump said, "the FBI director is wrong."

===Special Counsel's report===
{{Main|Mueller Report}}In February 2018, when Special Counsel Mueller indicted more than a dozen Russians and three entities for interference in the 2016 election, Trump's response was to assert that the indictment was proof his campaign did not collude with the Russians.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=February 17, 2018|title=Trump's Conspicuous Silence Leaves a Struggle Against Russia Without a Leader|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/us/politics/trump-russia.html|access-date=February 18, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' noted Trump "voiced no concern that a foreign power had been trying for nearly four years to upend American democracy, much less resolve to stop it from continuing to do so this year".&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

In July 2018, the special counsel indicted twelve Russian intelligence operatives and accused them of conspiring to interfere in the 2016 U.S. elections, by hacking servers and emails of the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Read: Mueller indictment against twelve Russian spies for DNC hack|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/7/13/17568806/mueller-russia-intelligence-indictment-full-text|access-date=July 28, 2018|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictments were made before Trump's meeting with Putin in Helsinki, in which Trump supported Putin's denial that Russia was involved and criticized American law enforcement and intelligence community (subsequently Trump partially walked back some of his comments).&lt;ref name="trump_intelligence"&gt;{{cite news|title=From the Start, Trump Has Muddied a Clear Message: Putin Interfered|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/world/europe/trump-intelligence-russian-election-meddling-.html|access-date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, it was reported that Trump had actually been briefed on the veracity and extent of Russian cyber-attacks two weeks before his inauguration, back in December 2016, including the fact that these were ordered by Putin himself.&lt;ref name="trump_intelligence" /&gt; The evidence presented to him at the time included text and email conversations between Russian military officers as well as information from a source close to Putin.&lt;ref name="trump_intelligence" /&gt;

On March 22, 2019, Special Counsel Robert Mueller submitted the final report to Attorney General William Barr.

I, p. 4: At the same time the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas "DCLeaks" and "Guccifer 2.0". The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.&lt;/ref&gt; To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators used the legal standard for criminal [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] rather than the popular concept of "collusion", because a crime of "collusion" is not found in criminal law or the [[United States Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morais|first=Betsy|title=Collusion by any other name|url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php|date=April 18, 2019|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|access-date=April 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of "collusion". In so doing, the Office recognized that the word "collud[e]" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, the investigation "identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign", and found that Russia had "perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency" and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign "expected it would benefit electorally" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, "the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ostriker|first1=Rebecca|last2=Puzzanghera|first2=Jim|last3=Finucane|first3=Martin|last4=Datar|first4=Saurabh|last5=Uraizee|first5=Irfan|last6=Garvin|first6=Patrick|title=What the Mueller report says about Trump and more|url=https://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/graphics/2019/03/mueller-report/|website=[[The Boston Globe]]|access-date=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Law|first=Tara|title=Here Are the Biggest Takeaways From the Mueller Report|url=http://time.com/5567077/mueller-report-release/|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of Trump campaign providing either false, incomplete or declined testimony (exercising the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]), as well as having deleted, unsaved or encrypted communications.

Following release of the Mueller Report, Trump and his allies turned their attention toward "investigating the investigators".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/investigate-the-investigators-is-new-trump-rallying-cry-to-counter-mueller-report/2019/05/04/9319b520-6db6-11e9-be3a-33217240a539_story.html|title='Investigate the investigators' is new Trump rallying cry to counter Mueller report|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 23, 2019, Trump ordered the [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] to cooperate with Barr's investigation of the origins of the investigation, granting Barr full authority to declassify any intelligence information related to the matter.

===Role of lobbyists===
During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to "[[drain the swamp]]"{{snd}}a phrase that usually refers to entrenched corruption and lobbying in Washington, D.C.{{snd}}and he proposed a series of ethics reforms.&lt;ref name="bschrekinger11182016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-proposes-ethics-reform-229911|title=Trump proposes ethics reforms|date=October 17, 2016|newspaper=Politico|last=Schrekinger|first=Ben|access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to federal records and interviews, there has been a dramatic increase in lobbying by corporations and hired interests during Trump's tenure, particularly through the office of Vice-President Mike Pence.&lt;ref name=wapopence&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pence-turns-vps-office-into-gateway-for-lobbyists-to-influence-the-trump-administration/2018/06/14/75675bfa-6424-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html|title=Pence turns VP's office into gateway for lobbyists to influence the Trump administration|first1=Michael|last1=Scherer|first2=Josh|last2=Dawsey|first3=Anu|last3=Narayanswamy|date=June 15, 2018|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; About twice as many lobbying firms contacted Pence, compared to previous presidencies, among them representatives of major energy firms and drug companies.&lt;ref name=wapopence/&gt; In many cases, the lobbyists have charged their clients millions of dollars for access to the vice president, and then have turned around and donated the money to Pence's political causes.&lt;ref name=wapopence/&gt;

Among the administration's first policies was a five-year ban on serving as a lobbyist after working in the executive branch.&lt;ref name="bschrekinger11182016"/&gt; However, as one of his final acts of office, Trump rolled back that policy, thus allowing administration staff to work as lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Trump Revokes Administration Ethics Rules On His Way Out The Door|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/inauguration-day-live-updates/2021/01/20/958710562/trump-revokes-administration-ethics-rules-on-his-way-out-the-door|access-date=2021-01-20|website=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential conflicts of interest===

In March 2018, ''The New York Times'' reported that [[George Nader (businessman)|George Nader]] had turned Trump's major fundraiser [[Elliott Broidy]] "into an instrument of influence at the White House for the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates{{nbs}}... High on the agenda of the two men{{nbs}}... was pushing the White House to remove Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson|Rex W.

''The New York Times''. March 21, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency and data availability===
''The Washington Post'' reported in May 2017, "a wide variety of information that until recently was provided to the public, limiting access, for instance, to disclosures about workplace violations, energy efficiency, and animal welfare abuses" had been removed or tucked away. The Obama administration had used the publication of enforcement actions taken by federal agencies against companies as a way to name and shame companies that engaged in unethical and illegal behaviors.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/under-trump-inconvenient-data-is-being-sidelined/2017/05/14/3ae22c28-3106-11e7-8674-437ddb6e813e_story.html|title=Under Trump, inconvenient data is being sidelined|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hatch Act violations===
In the first three and a half years of Trump's term, the [[Office of Special Counsel]], an independent federal government ethics agency, found 13 senior Trump administration officials in violation of the [[Hatch Act of 1939]], which restricts the government employees' involvement in politics; 11 of the complaints were filed by the activist group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW).&lt;ref name=FloutNorms/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gomez/&gt; By comparison, CREW stated that it was aware of only two findings of Hatch Act violations during the eight years of the Obama administration.&lt;ref name=FloutNorms/&gt;

===Security clearances===
In March 2019 [[Tricia Newbold]], a White House employee working on security clearances, privately told the [[House Oversight Committee]] that at least 25 [[Trump administration]] officials had been granted security clearances over the objections of career staffers. Newbold also asserted that some of these officials had previously had their applications rejected for "disqualifying issues", only for those rejections to be overturned with inadequate explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-panel-interviews-whistleblower-tricia-newbold-about-white-house-security-clearances/|title=Whistleblower says 25 people given White House clearance despite rejections|last=Kaplan|first=Rebecca|date=April 1, 2019|work=CBS News|access-date=April 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-whistleblower-says-she-felt-humiliated-after-retaliation-boss-n990171|title=White House whistleblower says she felt humiliated after retaliation from boss|last1=Strickler|first1=Laura|last2=Alexander|first2=Peter|last3=Schapiro|first3=Rich|date=April 2, 2019|work=NBC News|access-date=April 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/us/politics/tricia-newbold-whistle-blower-white-house.html|title=White House Whistle-Blower Did the Unexpected: She Returned to Work|last=Rogers|first=Katie|date=April 1, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 3, 2019|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed former head of White House security clearances [[Carl Kline (White House official)|Carl Kline]] to give testimony, the administration instructed Kline not to comply with the subpoena, asserting that the subpoena "unconstitutionally encroaches on fundamental executive branch interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=White House instructs official to ignore Democratic subpoena over security clearances|work=Washington Post|access-date=April 23, 2019|date=April 22, 2019|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/23/white-house-instructs-official-ignore-democratic-subpoena-over-security-clearances/|first=Tom|last=Hamburger|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423070501/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/23/white-house-instructs-official-ignore-democratic-subpoena-over-security-clearances/| archive-date=April 23, 2019| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=White House tells official not to comply with Democratic subpoena over security clearances|work=CNN Politics|access-date=April 23, 2019|date=April 22, 2019|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/22/politics/carl-kline-subpoena/index.html|first1=Manu|last1=Raju|first2=Sara|last2=Murray|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423032920/https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/22/politics/carl-kline-subpoena/index.html|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kline eventually gave closed-door testimony before the committee in May 2019, but House Democrats said he did not "provide specific details to their questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=Leigh|title=House Democrats not satisfied with Kline answers on security clearances|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-democrats-not-satisfied-kline-answers-security-clearances-n1000911|work=[[NBC News]]|access-date=May 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impeachment inquiry===
{{Main|Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump}}
{{See also|Trump–Ukraine scandal}}

On August 12, 2019, an unnamed intelligence official privately filed a whistleblower complaint with [[Michael Atkinson (Inspector General)|Michael Atkinson]], the [[Inspector General of the Intelligence Community]] (ICIG), under the provisions of the [[Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act]] (ICWPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esteban|first1=Chiqui|last2=Rabinowitz|first2=Kate|last3=Meko|first3=Tim|last4=Uhrmacher|first4=Kevin|title=Who's who in the whistleblower complaint|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/27/whos-who-whistleblower-complaint/|access-date=October 1, 2019|date=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whistleblower alleged that Trump had abused his office in soliciting foreign interference to improve his own electoral chances in 2020. The complaint reports that in a July 2019 call, Trump had asked Ukrainian president [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] to investigate potential 2020 rival presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son [[Hunter Biden]], as well as matters pertaining to whether Russian interference occurred in the 2016 U.S. election with regard to Democratic National Committee servers and the company Crowdstrike. Trump allegedly nominated his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to work with Ukraine on these matters. Additionally, the whistleblower alleged that the White House attempted to "lock down" the call records in a cover-up, and that the call was part of a wider pressure campaign by Giuliani and the Trump administration to urge Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The whistleblower posits that the pressure campaign may have included Trump cancelling Vice President Mike Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip, and Trump withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Korte|first=Gregory|title=The Whistle-Blower Complaint Against Trump, Annotated|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-trump-ukraine-whistleblower-complaint-transcript/|access-date=October 1, 2019|work=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/cdd0d1da48e045c39c383d589ad919f6|title=6 takeaways from the whistleblower complaint, including Rudy Giuliani's central role|work=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 27, 2019|access-date=October 1, 2019|first1=Michael|last1=Balsamo|first2=Colleen|last2=Long}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/26/politics/whistleblower-complaint-released/index.html|title=Whistleblower says White House tried to cover up Trump's abuse of power|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=September 26, 2019|access-date=September 26, 2019|first1=Marshall|last1=Cohen|first2=Katelyn|last2=Polantz|first3=David|last3=Shortell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olorunnipa|first1=Toluse|last2=Parker|first2=Ashley|title=Pence seeks to dodge impeachment spotlight as his Ukrainian moves attract notice|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pence-seeks-to-dodge-impeachment-spotlight-as-his-ukrainian-moves-attract-notice/2019/09/26/d397bdea-e07a-11e9-be96-6adb81821e90_story.html|access-date=October 1, 2019|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspector General Atkinson found the whistleblower's complaint both urgent and credible, so he transmitted the complaint on August 26 to [[Joseph Maguire]], the acting [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI). Under the law, Maguire was supposed to forward the complaint to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees within a week. Maguire refused, so Atkinson informed the congressional committees of the existence of the complaint, but not its content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kiely|first1=Eugene|last2=Roberston|first2=Lori|last3=Gore|first3=D'Angelo|title=The Whistleblower Complaint Timeline|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2019/09/the-whistleblower-complaint-timeline/|access-date=October 1, 2019|work=[[Factcheck.org]]|date=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wapotut"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bump|first1=Philip|last2=Blake|first2=Aaron|title=The full Trump-Ukraine timeline – as of now|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/24/full-trump-ukraine-timeline-now/|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=October 1, 2019|date=September 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general counsel for Maguire's office said that since the complaint was not about someone in the intelligence community, it was not an "urgent concern" and thus there was no need to pass it to Congress.

In December 2020, shortly before Christmas and in his last month in office, Trump granted 26 people full pardons and commuted the sentences of three others convicted of federal crimes.

====Cost of trips====
According to several reports, Trump's and his family's trips in the first month of his presidency cost U.S. taxpayers nearly as much as former president Obama's travel expenses for an entire year. When Obama was president, Trump frequently criticized him for taking vacations which were paid for with public funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-costs-trips-security-taxpayer-barack-obama-month-year-a7586261.html|title=In a month, the Trump family has cost taxpayers almost as much as the Obamas did in a year|date=February 17, 2017|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported that Trump's atypically lavish lifestyle is far more expensive to the taxpayers than what was typical of former presidents and could end up in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the whole of Trump's term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-familys-elaborate-lifestyle-a-logistical-nightmare--at-taxpayer-expense/2017/02/16/763cce8e-f2ce-11e6-a9b0-ecee7ce475fc_story.html|title=Trump family's elaborate lifestyle is a 'logistical nightmare' – at taxpayer expense|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 2019 analysis by the ''Washington Post'' found that federal officials and GOP campaigns had spent at least $1.6{{nbs}}million at businesses owned by Trump during his presidency.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/when-trump-visits-his-clubs-government-agencies-and-republicans-pay-to-be-where-he-is/2019/06/20/a4c13c36-8ed0-11e9-adf3-f70f78c156e8_story.html|title=When Trump visits his clubs, government agencies and Republicans pay to be where he is|date=2019|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an undercount, as most of the data on spending by government officials covered only the first few months of Trump's presidency.&lt;ref name=":33"/&gt;

By January 20, 2017, [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]], Trump's approval rating average was forty-two percent, the lowest rating average for an incoming president in the history of modern polling;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/us/politics/donald-trump-obama-approval-rating.html|title=Trump Entering White House Unbent and Unpopular|last=Baker|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Baker (author)|date=January 17, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his term it has been an "incredibly stable (and also historically low)" thirty-six to forty percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html|title=President Trump Job Approval|publisher=[[RealClearPolitics|Real Clear Politics]]|access-date=May 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/21/politics/family-separation-midterms-analysis/index.html|title=Separated immigrant children move people's hearts, but will it move their votes?|last=Enten|first=Harry|date=June 21, 2018|website=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic backsliding===
{{Main|Democratic backsliding}}

Since the beginning of the presidency of Donald Trump, ratings of how well U.S. democracy is functioning sharply plunged.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/3f/19/3f19efc9-e25f-4356-b159-b5c0ec894115/v-dem_democracy_report_2018.pdf|title=Democracy for All?

According to the 2018 [[V-DEM|Varieties of Democracy]] Annual Democracy Report, there has been "a significant [[democratic backsliding]] in the United States [since the [[Inauguration of Donald Trump]]]{{nbs}}... attributable to weakening constraints on the executive."&lt;ref name=":34"/&gt; Independent assessments by [[Freedom House]] and [[Bright Line Watch]] found a similar significant decline in overall democratic functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/united-states|title=Freedom in the World 2018 {{!}} United States|date=January 16, 2018|website=[[Freedom House]]|access-date=February 20, 2019|quote=Newly elected president Donald Trump, who took office in January, defied ethical standards observed by his recent predecessors, for instance by retaining and promoting his private business empire while in office, naming his daughter and son-in-law as presidential advisers, and refusing to divulge his tax records.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brightlinewatch.org/wave7/|title=Bright Line Watch: Wave VII|date=November 15, 2018|website=[[Bright Line Watch]]|access-date=February 20, 2019|quote=The trajectories sketched by V-Dem and by the Bright Line Watch experts are remarkably consistent over time, though the Bright Line Watch assessments are a bit more tempered (slightly higher than V-Dem from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th, slightly lower since). Notably, both indices drop sharply in the last few years of the series. V-Dem's data end in 2017 but Bright Line Watch experts perceive further decline in 2018 (from 76 in 2015 to 69 in 2017 to 64 now). We interpret this decline as a response to the events of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Trump presidency.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
